These notebooks were used to develop a domain adaptation method to enable the training of plasmoid detection models on simulated rather than real data. The method was ultimately unsatisfactory, so this code will not be developed further. In particular, the code would need serious refactors in order to be easily usable by others. If you are interested in running this code yourself, please contact me for assistance.
